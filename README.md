# XPERIENCE (XPNC)

## Overview

Welcome to the Xperience (XPNC) repository! Xperience is an innovative platform where volunteering meets gaming. Our aim is to revolutionize the volunteering and philanthropic space by rewarding volunteers with XPNC tokens that can be redeemed for various benefits.

Our unique approach combines the engagement of RPG gaming with real-world volunteer activities. Our users navigate through an immersive game world, accept missions (volunteer tasks), and earn tokens upon completion. This repository contains the base game built on the ThirdWeb RPG game template, and will be updated as we add custom features to enrich the user experience.

# Gameplay

In the Xperience game world of 'Tshwaneville', players spawn into a vibrant, interactive environment. They can explore the virtual landscape, engaging with various characters and objects that bring the world to life. Every interaction has the potential to offer new quests or side missions, adding depth and variety to the gameplay.

The heart of Tshwaneville is the 'Town Hall', a hub for social impact where players can find non-profits in need of volunteers. Here, players can accept main missions that correspond to real-world volunteering opportunities. By participating in these missions, players contribute to their communities while also advancing in the game.

Upon successful completion of a mission and subsequent verification by a designated official from the non-profit, players are minted a unique NFT. This NFT serves as a digital receipt of their volunteering efforts, tangible proof of their contributions.

Once a player has their volunteering NFT, they can traverse the map to the 'Bank'. Here they have the choice to stake or sell their NFTs, converting their real-world efforts into digital rewards. However, accessing these DeFi options isn't straightforward. Players must first interact with specific characters on the map, such as a Wizard or a proudly South African street vendor, who will guide them on side quests. Only upon completion of these side quests will players unlock the passive income opportunities at the Bank.

This unique gameplay model seamlessly blends RPG gaming with philanthropy, creating a fun, engaging experience that also generates real-world impact. Our aim is to keep the gameplay simple and intuitive, making it accessible to all players while maintaining a focus on our core objective of promoting volunteering

# Features

Dynamic Gameplay: Players navigate through 'Tshwaneville', a virtual world, interacting with various characters and objects, completing side quests and missions that lead to real-world benefits.

Volunteer Work Integration: The main missions link players to non-profits in need of service. Upon completion of volunteer work, players receive a unique NFT, serving as a digital receipt for their volunteering.

Simple Web3 Onboarding - Wallet Integration will be the first interaction the players character will face upon entering 'Tshwaneville'. This will enable users to store their tokens and view their NFTs and interact with the various assets in the game.

Recycling Economy: The staked tokens are recycled back into various funding pools to incentivize more philanthropic work, creating a self-sustaining and rewarding ecosystem.

Accessible Gameplay: Despite the various layers of functionality, the game is designed to be simple and easy to play. The user-friendly interface ensures an enjoyable gaming experience without taking away from the main objective of volunteering.
